Below is a list of the public projects for which I am an active developer.

## [PHP CS Fixer Config]

This is my default php-cs-fixer rules I follow in my projects.
It allows me to easily include my rules into any new project,
and to only include the rules that are appropriate for the given PHP version.

## [YNAB Tools]

This is still in its very early stages.
But I hope for it to become a set of tools to use with my favorite budgeting software, [You Need A Budget].
I'm taking my time with it so I can experiment with various architectural patterns and so use it as a learning opportunity as well.

## [BackWPup]

I'm also the lead developer on [BackWPup], a WordPress plugin for backing up your website.
